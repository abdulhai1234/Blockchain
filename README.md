# Blockchain
This repo contains the basic to advance concepts of etherum blockchain in solidity programming language.

## What is solidity programming language?
Solidity is a contract-oriented language designed to compile code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This repo is all about the basic concepts of Solidity programming to build smart contracts for Ethereum and blockchain from the ground up. It will enable you to write robust, secure, object-oriented contracts that extend blockchain with business functionality.

This repo covers the following exciting features:

* Learn proven smart contract implementation challenges and solve them using Solidity
* Go deeper into Solidity to write effective upgradable and maintainable smart contracts using best practices
* Get to grips with the latest version of Solidity with updated codes and examples


**Following is what you need for this repo:**
This repo is primarily aimed at beginners who want to get started with Solidity Programming for developing an Ethereum smart contract. No prior knowledge of EVM is required, but knowing the basics of any programming language will help you follow along.
